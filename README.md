# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days in maps from the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, with data on a third map, night navigation.

## Maps shown below:

* The map below is in street layer view with earthquake, tectonic plates, and major earthquake data overlays

* The maps below show first the Earth in night navigation layer view with only the tectonic plates overlay, then the major earthquakes overlay is added, finally the earthequake data overlay is added.
