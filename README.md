The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days and the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, with data on a third map.
